# SQL
SQL project for my studies. 

The script creates a database called "MalinowskyCarRental" and several tables within it.
It starts by checking if the database already exists, and if so it drops it, and creates a new one. 
It then creates three tables, one called "Pracownicy" which stores information about employees, 
another called "Bazy" which stores information about bases, and another called "Klienci" which stores information about customers. 
Each table has a set of fields, such as employee ID, name, address, etc. The script also includes constraints on some fields, 
such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique values. Finally, the script adds sample data to each table.
